# TODO:

 - Add more attacks
 - Refactoring
   - Sometimes use qualified imports to do stuff like Z.health and G.health
   - Name stuff better (more descriptive and consistent)
   - Make a good naming convention for differentiating properties of Zombie and ZombieType
 - Return an Either in parseInput, not Maybe
